\title{Extract information of a base-learner}
\usage{
\method{extract}{blg}(object, what = c("design", "penalty", "index"),
  asmatrix = FALSE, expand = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{a base-learner}

\item{what}{a character specifying the quantities to extract.
This can be a subset of "design" (default; design matrix),
"penalty" (penalty matrix) and "index" (index of ties used to expand
the design matrix)}

\item{asmatrix}{a logical indicating whether the the returned matrix should be
coerced to a matrix (default) or if the returned object stays as it is
(i.e., potentially a sparse matrix). This option is only applicable if \code{extract}
returns matrices, i.e., \code{what = "design"} or \code{what = "penalty"}.}

\item{expand}{a logical indicating whether the design matrix should be expanded
(default: \code{FALSE}). This is useful if ties were taken into account either manually
(via argument \code{index} in a base-learner) or automatically for data sets with many
observations. \code{expand = TRUE} is equivalent to \code{extract(B)[extract(B, what = "index"),]}
for a base-learner \code{B}.}

\item{...}{currently not used}
}

Takes a base-learner and extracts information.
