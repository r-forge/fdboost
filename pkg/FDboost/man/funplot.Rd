\title{Plot functional data with linear interpolation of missing values}
\usage{
  funplot(x, y, id = NULL, rug = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{optional, time-vector for plotting}

  \item{y}{matrix of functional data with functions in rows
  and measured times in columns}

  \item{id}{defaults to NULL for y matrix, is id-variables
  for y in long format}

  \item{rug}{logical. Should rugs be plotted? Defaults to
  TRUE.}

  \item{...}{further arguments passed to
  \code{\link[graphics]{matplot}}.}
}
\description{
  Plot functional data with linear interpolation of missing
  values
}
\details{
  All observations are marked by a small cross
  (\code{pch=3}). Missing values are imputed by linear
  interpolation. Parts that are interpolated are plotted by
  dotted lines, parts with non-missing values as solid
  lines.
