\title{Functional MRD}
\usage{
funMRD(object, overTime = TRUE, breaks = object$yind, global = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{fitted FDboost-object with regular response}

\item{overTime}{per default the functional MRD is calculated over time
if \code{overTime=FALSE}, the MRD is calculated per curve}

\item{breaks}{an optional vector or number giving the time-points at which the model is evaluated.
Can be specified as number of equidistant time-points or as vector of time-points.
Defaults to the index of the response in the model.}

\item{global}{logical. defaults to \code{FALSE},
if TRUE the global MRD like in a normal linear model is calculated}

\item{...}{currently not used}
}
\value{
Returns a vector with the calculated MRD and some extra information in attributes.
}
\description{
Calculates the functional MRD for a fitted FDboost-object
}
\details{
Formula to calculate MRD over time, \code{overTime=TRUE}: \cr
\eqn{ MRD(t) = n^{-1} \sum_i |Y_i(t) - \hat{Y}_i(t)| / |Y_i(t)| }

Formula to calculate MRD over subjects, \code{overTime=FALSE}: \cr
\eqn{ MRD_{i} = \int |Y_i(t) - \hat{Y}_i(t)| / |Y_i(t)| dt  \approx G^{-1} \sum_g |Y_i(t_g) - \hat{Y}_i(t_g)| / |Y_i(t)|}
}
\note{
\code{breaks} cannot be changed in the case the \code{bsignal()}
is used over the same domain
as the response! In that case you would have to rename the index of the response or that
of the covariates.
