\usage{
  funMSE(object, overTime = TRUE, breaks = object$yind,
    global = FALSE, relative = FALSE, root = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{object}{fitted FDboost-object}

  \item{overTime}{per default the functional R-squared is
  calcualted over time if \code{overTime=FALSE}, the
  R-squared is calculated per curve}

  \item{breaks}{an optional vector or number giving the
  timepoints at which the model is evaluated. Can be
  specified as number of equidistant time-points or as
  vector of time-points. Defaults to the index of the
  response in the model.}

  \item{global}{logical. defaults to \code{FALSE}, if TRUE
  the global R-squared like in a normal linear model is
  calculated}

  \item{relative}{logical. defaults to \code{FALSE}. If
  \code{TRUE} the MSE is standardized by the global
  variance of the response \cr \eqn{ n^{-1} \int \sum_i
  (Y_i(t) - \bar{Y})^2 dt \approx G^{-1} n^{-1} \sum_g
  \sum_i (Y_i(t_g) - \bar{Y})^2 }}

  \item{root}{take the square root of the MSE}

  \item{...}{currently not used}
}
\value{
  Returns a vector with the calculated MSE and some extra
  information in attributes.
}
\description{
  Claculates the functional MSE for a fitted FDboost-object
}
\details{
  Formula to calculate MSE over time, \code{overTime=TRUE}:
  \cr \eqn{ MSE(t) = n^{-1} \sum_i (Y_i(t) -
  \hat{Y}_i(t))^2 }

  Formula to calculate MSE over subjects,
  \code{overTime=FALSE}: \cr \eqn{ MSE_i = \int (Y_i(t) -
  \hat{Y}_i(t))^2 dt \approx G^{-1} \sum_g (Y_i(t_g) -
  \hat{Y}_i(t_g))^2}
}
\note{
  \code{breaks} cannot be changed in the case the
  \code{bsignal()} is used over the same domain as the
  response! In that case you would have to rename the index
  of the response or that of the covariates.
